    <h2>About tradecraft</h2>
    <p>Tradecraft, within the intelligence community, refers to the techniques, methods and technologies used in modern espionage (spying) and generally, as part of the activity of intelligence assessment. This includes general topics or techniques (dead drops, for example), or the specific techniques of a nation or organization (the particular form of encryption (encoding) used by the National Security Agency, for example).</p>

    <h2>Why spy?</h2>
    <p>The identification of potential agents is termed "agent spotting" (also termed "talent spotting") and it's fun and profitable! Identifying potential agents, and investigating the details of their personal and professional lives, involves the granular verification of their bona fides. Such activities can include uncovering personal details that leave potential agents vulnerable to coercion, blackmail, or other inducements and approaches.</p>
